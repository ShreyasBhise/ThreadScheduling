Implement a pure user-level thread library that has a similar interface to the C pthread library and pthread mutexes to guarantee exclusive 
access to critical sections of the code. Since these threads are purely in user-space (there is only 1 allocated kernel thread) we need to 
have a scheduler that implements the following scheduling policies: round robin (RR) and multi-level feedback queue (MLFQ).
